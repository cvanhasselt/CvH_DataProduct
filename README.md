The name of the project is the **My Kind of Movies!** app and 
is based on data found through the Grouplens Project, (http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
and uses data from their benchmark dataset(http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)
of 100,000 movie ratings of 1,700 different movies from one-thousand survey respondents.
